Please do a thorough build and architecture review of the codebase to understand how things flow from an operational and user perspective. I want you to think about features and how people interact. I want you to explore new features and options to expand our offering—making sure you reference the research files within this repo to guide you on what is and isn't possible. Use review skills as needed to perform this task. If you are unsure about something or want to explore options, research online. Start by creating a thorough security review plan as a .md file. Your first output should be the review plan, and your second output, once I have reviewed the plan, will be the review report itself, which should also be a .md file for me to review.

Please do a thorough security review of the build. Look for areas where data is unencrypted but should be, XSS vulnerabilities, and any other backdoor routes. We need this codebase to be an iron mountain. Use security review skills as needed to perform your task. If you are unsure about something or want to explore options, research online. Start by creating a thorough security review plan as a .md file. Your first output should be the architecture and strategy review plan and your second output, once I have reviewed the plan, will be the review report itself, which should also be a .md file for me to review.
